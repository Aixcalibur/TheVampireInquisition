The Vampire Inquisition is a new ambitious vampire mod that allows vampires to be landless rulers and influence the world from the shadows. It is currently in an alpha state, with many systems implemented in place, but needing polish and balance. I hope to make a challenging and well-balanced experience for immortal rulers as I was not satisfied with the existing vampire mods, so please give me feedback (don't worry I have thick skin).
