The lore of this mod is always subject to change and retcon. The goal of the lore is to narratively support the gameplay and facilitate player fantasy. For this reason, many areas of the lore may be left vague and open to the player to fill in the blanks. Any lore that does exist should be presented to the player in-game as it becomes relevant to them. Lore that is not related to something immediately planned to be implemented should be avoided or added to the FLAVOR document instead.
