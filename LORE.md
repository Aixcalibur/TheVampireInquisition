The lore of this mod is always subject to change and retcon. The goal of the lore is to narratively support the gameplay and facilitate player fantasy. For this reason, many areas of the lore may be left vague and open to the player to fill in the blanks. Any lore that does exist should be presented to the player in-game as it becomes relevant to them. Lore that is not related to something immediately planned to be implemented should be avoided or added to the FLAVOR document instead.

### Vampires
* In general, vampires *do not undergo special personality changes* such as loss of empathy. Any personality changes can be attributed to personal or environmental factors (e.g. coping with the thirst to feed on humans), the corruption of power, or the long passage of time.
* Represented by the **Heliophobic** trait, vampires are weakened during the day, *even when not directly exposed to the sun*, to the extent that weaker vampires may be bedridden. Direct exposure to the sun will cause a vampire to immolate and even the most powerful vampires will be reduced to ashes within seconds.
* Vampires must regularly drain blood directly from a living being. There is no in-game mechanic for feeding, it is assumed that any vampire can easily source blood from the local commonfolk. They prefer the blood of humans, but animals can sustain them to a lesser extent. If a vampire goes without blood for a certain amount of time, such as when they are imprisoned, the thirst can make them **Feral** until they are fed.
* Mortals that are fed on by a vampire will have a permanent **Drained** modifier which provides a health debuff. This debuff can stack, eventually killing a person.
* Most lasting effects of vampiric powers are weakened during the day and may be completely cleansed by sunlight. For this reason, vampiric thralls also receive the **Heliophobic** trait.
* Vampires may sleep if they wish, they can decide before they sleep how long they will sleep for, though the exact length becomes harder to control the longer the period. It usually takes around twenty minutes for a vampire to completely fall asleep. While completely asleep, they will be identical to a corpse and completely unaware of their surroundings, but they will be unaffected by thirst or sunlight unless they wake up. Gameplay-wise, *this allows players to retire their immortal vampire characters without killing them*.
* A new vampire is created when a mortal absorbs a bit of **Vampiric Essence** at the moment of death. This process is called the **Embrace**. The donor vampire is called a **sire** and gets a **Perpetual Hook** on their new **spawn** to represent a certain amount of supernatural compulsion the sire can exert. The process of creating a new vampire is risky simply because most vampires do not want to waste too much of their **Vampiric Essence** to make sure the absorption happens at the right time.
* Vampires have a massive debuff to fertility (-200%), but are not incapable of having natural children. These children are born sickly, but are otherwise mortal and will age normally. Once they are past the age of 18, they may be embraced without any of the usual risk of death.
* Every vampire starts with an initial amount of **Vampiric Essence** according to their **Vampire Generation**, which is one Generation lower than the Generation of their sire. This Essence translates into supernatural prowess and presence such that even the weakest vampire might be able to overpower a trained knight in a grappling match. Vampiric prowess is only added as *temporary modifier* because it is only usable in special contexts that take place at night.
* Each time a vampire feeds from a human, they accumulate a bit of Essence. The improvement is so miniscule that it usually does not become apparent until several decades of activity.
* The fastest way for a new vampire to accumulate Essence is by draining another vampire to death, allowing one to steal a portion of the victim's Essence. This will also improve their Vampire Generation by one step if they drain from a higher Generation vampire.

### Holy Artifacts
The role of Holy Artifacts is to provide a significant and plausible threat to vampires. Otherwise, vampires could just assassinate the leaders of any Inquisition.
* The magical effects of **Holy Artifacts** are not immediately perceptable to mortals, generally they subtly improve the mental abilities of their owner over time. *(This is in reference to vanilla artifact mechanics.)*
* The most visible effect of **Holy Artifacts** is that they can have a similar effect as the Sun on vampires and vampiric magic. Vampires will be weakened in proximity to these artifacts or, in the case of more powerful artifacts, forced into slumber. Direct touch can possibly reduce vampires to ashes.
* Vampires cannnot equip **Holy Artifacts**. Any **Holy Artifact** will be automatically destroyed if acquired by a vampire. Gameplay-wise, this allows them to be found again. (Need verification)
* In terms of gameplay effects, this means that vampires will be unable to directly attack mortals with **Holy Artifacts** equipped. When a mortal attempts to hunt a vampire while they have a **Holy Artifact** equipped, the vampire is prevented from taking any actions other than hiding or fleeing.
* In the future, artifacts may be given grades of holiness.

### Vampire Bloodlines
The various vampire bloodlines serve to allow multiple interpretations of vampires to exist, to change gameplay and provide unique buffs and weaknesses, and to overall add flavor to vampires.
* **Carmine Bloodline**: The seducers that appear in cautionary myths. The following traits will be removed upon becoming a vampire of this bloodline: Homely, Ugly, Hideous, Lisping, Scaly, Club-Footed, Hunchbacked, Wheezing, Spindly, Bleeder. As their **Vampiric Essence** increases, they will also gain congenital beauty traits if they do not have them already.
* **Nosferatu Bloodline**: Becoming a vampire of this bloodline will automatically remove any beauty trait and grant the Hideous trait. They lose masquerade faster, but accumulate **Vampiric Essence** faster.
* **Unknown Bloodline**: For any vampire that is not part of another bloodline. They have no special traits associated with them.


### Vampire Princes
These vampires generally control the supernatural underworld around them. Some are also given death protection unless they are killed through mechanics provided by this mod, respawning them in case something else kills them.
* **Baba Yaga** [3rd Gen/Nosferatu][Fickle/Arbitrary/Patient] - An inscrutable witch who wanders the wilderness of Eastern Europe. As long as she is active, people of Slavic cultures and faiths may Visit her (a pilgrimage-like activity) to receive powerful boons or debuffs. Vampires may instead beseech her to teach them magic.
* **Esclarmonde** [5th Gen/Carmine][Gregarious/Ambitious/Vengeful] - A centuries-old Frankish vampire sorceress who leads the Court of Roses centered in Paris and member of the Crimson Council. She regularly hosts extravagant Soirees to ensnare mortal nobility into her circle of influence. She is protected by the Order of the Thorn, a mortal mercenary order lead by her vampire spawn Roland.
* **Marcus Laurentius** [5th Gen/Carmine][Patient/Deceitful/Cynical] - A relic of the Roman Republic who is the current Prince of Milan and a member of the Crimson Council.

### Vampire Hunters
Vampire hunting organizations tend to rise and fall as vampires avoid a region or go into hiding, leaving the organization unable to prove their usefulness even to their own members. Nevertheless, the older vampires are incredibly wary of the consequences of 

### Combat and Raids
As vampires can only act at night, raids are one of the few places where vampires can exert their supernatural strength. However, inquisitors know to begin their attacks at dawn or at noon at the very latest to give them the maximum time to hunt down the vampire's resting place while it is vulnerable.
