# CK3: The Vampire Inquisition
Beyond just new perks, powers, and artifacts, CK3: The Vampire Inquisition aims to deliver well-balanced and flavor-rich unlanded gameplay in the base world of Crusader Kings 3, with minimal compatibility issues with other mods.

### Manipulate the world from the shadows
Vampires don't need to directly hold land to generate income. Instead, they hold Princedoms, landless titles that allow them to siphon income from mortal rulers while they pose as local nobility. Furthermore, as a Vampire Prince, it is your responsibility to prevent the public at large from learning of the existence of vampires and triggering an *Inquisition* or worse.

### Plunder the bounty of (un)dead kings
Some vampires have spent centuries collecting valuable artifacts. Rather than letting those artifacts rot in some geriatric's collection, would you not make better use of them yourself? Whether you're a mortal, hunter, or vampire, successful raiding a vampire's lair will allow you a chance to steal one of their precious artifacts for yourself.

### Hold on to your humanity... or abandon it
While mortals can deal with their mortal stresses with heavy drink or healthy exercise, each time a vampire hits a stress break, they gain a stack of *Madness*.
