The lore of this mod is always subject to change and retcon. The goal of the lore is to narratively support the gameplay, provide flavor, and facilitate player fantasy. For this reason, many areas of the lore may be left vague and open to the player to fill in the blanks. Any lore that does exist should be presented to the player in-game as it becomes relevant to them. This document should be written in a concise manner.

## VAMPIRES
Vampires are undead beings that must feed on the blood of the living. They possess superhuman physical abilities, enhanced senses, and magical powers such as mind control and transformation. However, they lose most of their powers during the day and become extremely weak when exposed to sunlight, with older vampires outright burning on contact. This weakness prevents them from asserting dominance over humankind and makes it necessary for them to hide their true nature from mortals.
* In general, vampires act mostly the same as their mortal selves, except with a thirst for blood. Many personality changes can be attributed to personal or environmental factors (e.g. coping with having to feed on humans), the corruption of power, or simply the long passage of time.
* Vampires get thirstier when experiencing emotional distress or when using their powers. Experiencing thirst as a vampire can be harrowing or potentially liberating. Many vampires are tempted to let go entirely of their humanity.
* As vampires grow older, they grow stronger. However, upon becoming an Elder Vampire at around 200-300 years of age, they can no longer stand sunlight at all, which incapacitates their ability to attend most mortal functions.
* It is possible for a vampire to go into hibernation. Many Elder and Ancient Vampires feel a persistent drowsiness that can only be abated by hibernating for a few centuries.

### Bloodlines
The origins of vampires are unclear, it is possible that they may have multiple different origins. This is suggested by the existence of vampiric bloodlines or dynasties which grant additional changes. The distribution of bloodlines is far from equal, with Disians and Anunnaki currently holding dominance across Europe.
* **Disian Bloodline**: One of the most widespread vampire bloodlines, the one thing all Disians share is that they appear extraordinarily alluring under low light, though many are beautiful still in clear view. This manifests in-game as a bonus to personal schemes, attraction opinion, negation of diplomacy penalties, and greater stress loss.
* **Anunnaki Bloodline**: Some of the prouder Anunnaki hold that they were born to rule, for the Anunnaki have the ability to sharpen their minds, represented as a bonus to Rationality, Martial, and Stewardship at the cost of reduced stress relief.
* **Nosferatu Bloodline**: The Nosferatu have extraordinary senses, but seem to move unnaturally and fade easily into shadows. This grants them less General Opinion, but bonuses to Dynasty Opinion (To cancel out the General Opinion), Intrigue, and Prowess.
* **Strix Bloodline**: Even among vampires, the Strix are considered a plague at worst and a nuisance at best. They do not seem to have especially notable features, but are considerably prone to going feral. Nevertheless, notable Strix Elders exist. In-game, they have a boost to Learning, but a large boost to stress gain.
* **Ravana Bloodline**: One of the Rakshasa clans of India, said to originate from Sri Lanka. (Not implemented)
* **Ghatotkacha Bloodline**: One of the Rakshasa clans of India. (Not implemented)
* **Lotus Bloodline**: One of the Rakshasa clans of India. (Not implemented)

### Polities
For the initial release, we will only have the Court of Night as a fully fleshed out faction. Players are free, however, to create their own Princedoms wherever they want in the world.
* **The Court of Night**: A newly united kingdom of vampires centered in Paris composed of Germanic and Roman vampires. The Court of Night provides prestige, noble connections, and potential military support in exchange for fealty, information, and tribute.
* **The Golden Temple**: The domain of Bida, an Ancient Vampire who controls the gold trade and is worshipped as a god by the local kingdoms. His eventual death at the hand of a vampire hunter gives way to the conversion of the Mali Empire to Islam.
* **Rakshasa Clans**: Locked in violent conflict across the Indian subcontinent are the Rakshasa Clans. (Planned for second release)

## HUNTING VAMPIRES
Vampire hunting activities ebb and flow in cycles. After periods of vampire-hunting fervor, there are usually a few centuries of peace as the wiser vampires migrate or go into hiding, knowledge of vampires gets carefully erased, and funding for vampire hunting organizations get cut. At the moment, the only known human organization that maintains records of vampires is the Vatican.

### Holy Artifacts
The role of Holy Artifacts is to provide a significant and plausible threat to vampires. Otherwise, vampires could just assassinate the leaders of any Inquisition. Artifacts considered holy by humans have the hidden ability to ward off vampires by projecting an aura that weakens them and prevents them from drawing upon their supernatural powers. Minor holy symbols can make vampires uncomfortable, but usually not enough to dissuade them.
* The magical effects of **Holy Artifacts** are not immediately perceptable to mortals, generally they subtly improve the mental abilities of their owner over time. *(This is in reference to vanilla artifact mechanics.)*
* Vampires cannnot equip **Holy Artifacts**. Any **Holy Artifact** will be automatically destroyed if acquired by a vampire. Gameplay-wise, this allows them to be found again... I think. (Need verification)
* In terms of gameplay effects, this means that vampires will be unable to directly attack mortals with **Holy Artifacts** equipped.

### Michael the Archangel
Sleeping in a hidden crypt in Rome is an immensely powerful vampire who identifies himself as Michael the Archangel. Considered by many vampires to be insane, Michael exclusively feeds on other vampires and considers it his personal mission to devour vampires that would threaten humanity at large. He acts like a last resort and not meant to be beatable.
